        <p>Dev Equip was created Feb 26, 2022 on Discord. Since then, we've been uploading our assets with the purpose supporting developers on their journey to create spectacular games.</p>
        <p>We generally centered our community on Discord but we're ready to take a bigger step forward!</p>

            <h1 class="subtitle">Official Website</h1>
            <p>The official website of Dev Equip is still under development but we're actively working on updating it for a much more user-friendly feel whilst also bringing more content to our developers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You'll only be able to access three of our major products <a href="https://devequip.com/products/nexusdynamics">Nexus Dynamics 2.0</a> / <a href="https://devequip.com/products/donationboard3.0">Donation Board 3.0</a> / <a href="https://devequip.com/products/axisindicator">Axis Indicator</a> until we've developed a better marketplace for all our products.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Additionally, we'll post all our news/changelogs as <a href="https://devequip.com/blog">blogs</a> so we can write much cleaner looking post without limitations.</p>
            <br>
            <sub><b>THE STORE STATS SUCH AS REVIEWS AND DOWNLOADS ARE BASED OF THE ROBLOX CREATOR STORE UNTIL OUR OWN REVIEW SYSTEM</b></sub>

            <h1 class="subtitle">Official Discord Server</h1>
            <p>We're renovating the Discord server to be more of a dev community server whilst still running it as a central hub for developers. We'll notify any changes or new content from the website within specific channels, whilst having fun events with our community.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It'll be our main source of communication with our community whilst we continue to deliver high quality products!</p>

            <h1 class="subtitle">Future of Dev Equip</h1>
            <p>We're planning on creating a public marketplace for developers that would like to share free or paid creations using a similar design as our current products.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As we're continuing to develop the website further, we're going to be expanding our engine/platforms to: <br><b>Roblox | Unity | Unreal Engine | Blender | Visual Studio | HTML5</b></p>
